# Object Detection

## Overview

This project is a TensorFlow-based object detection library. It leverages the TensorFlow Models repository to provide various state-of-the-art object detection models, tools for training and evaluation, and scripts for data processing.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models:** Use pre-trained models from the TensorFlow Model Zoo.
- **Custom Training:** Train custom object detection models using your own datasets.
- **Data Augmentation:** Built-in support for various data augmentation techniques.
- **Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation tools to measure model performance.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.7.0
- TensorFlow I/O

### Setup

To install the necessary packages and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
    cd models/research

2. Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install the object detection package:

    pip install .

## Directory Structure

- `object_detection/`: Main directory containing the object detection code.
- `slim/`: Contains additional libraries and scripts for datasets, network architectures, preprocessing, deployment, and various utility scripts.

## Usage

### Training

To train a model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and convert it into the TFRecord format.
2. Update the configuration file with paths to your dataset and pre-trained model checkpoints.
3. Run the training script:

    python object_detection/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=path/to/model_dir --pipeline_config_path=path/to/pipeline.config

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model, use the evaluation script:

    python object_detection/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=path/to/model_dir --pipeline_config_path=path/to/pipeline.config --checkpoint_dir=path/to/checkpoint_dir

### Inference

To perform inference with a trained model, use the inference script provided in the `object_detection` directory:

    python object_detection/inference/infer_detections.py --input_tfrecord_paths=path/to/tfrecords --output_tfrecord_path=path/to/output_tfrecords --inference_graph=path/to/frozen_inference_graph.pb

## Jupyter Notebooks

This repository also includes Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating and experimenting with various aspects of object detection. To run the notebooks:

1. Install Jupyter:

    pip install jupyter

2. Start the Jupyter notebook server:

    jupyter notebook

3. Open and run the notebooks in your browser.
