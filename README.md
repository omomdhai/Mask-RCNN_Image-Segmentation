- Timestamps to track changes and updates.

## Installation

1. **Clone the TensorFlow Models Repository:**
   Clone the repository from the official TensorFlow GitHub.

2. **Compile the Object Detection API Protocol Buffers:**
   Navigate to the `models/research` directory and compile the protocol buffers.

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   Create and run a setup script to install necessary Python packages.

## Setup

1. **Mount Google Drive (if using Colab):**
   Mount your Google Drive to access datasets and save results.

2. **Unzip the Dataset:**
   Unzip the provided dataset to use it for image segmentation.

## Run

1. **Import Libraries:**
   Import TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, Matplotlib, PIL, and Object Detection API utilities.

2. **Load Image into Numpy Array:**
   Implement a function to load an image from a specified path into a numpy array.

3. **Select and Load Model:**
   Choose a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub and load it.

4. **Run Inference:**
   Perform inference on a test image using the loaded model and obtain the results.

5. **Visualize Results:**
   Visualize the segmentation results by overlaying the detected masks and bounding boxes on the original image.

6. **Save Results:**
   Save the visualized images with segmentation masks to disk.

## Training

This implementation uses pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub, so no additional training is required. However, if you wish to train your own model:

1. Prepare your dataset with images and annotations.
2. Configure the model and training parameters.
3. Use the TensorFlow Object Detection API to train the model on your dataset.
4. Evaluate the trained model on a validation set.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model:

1. Use a separate set of images not seen during training.
2. Run the inference process to get the predicted segmentation masks.
3. Compare the predictions with the ground truth annotations to calculate metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU).

## Interface

The interface for this project is primarily through Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. Visualization of the results is done using Matplotlib to display the images with segmentation masks overlaid.

## Results

After running the inference and visualization steps, the segmented images are saved with the detected objects highlighted with bounding boxes and masks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Mask R-CNN model for image segmentation tasks.
